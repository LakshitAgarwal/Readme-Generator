'''
âœ… Step-by-Step Flow:
Accept path of the cloned repo (e.g., /temp/abcd1234/).

Walk through the directory recursively.

Select important files (.js, .ts, .jsx, .py, .json, etc.).

For each file, summarize it using a selected LLM (like Gemini or Groq).

Combine all summaries into a single big summary.

Send it back to Node.js (stdout or file system).
